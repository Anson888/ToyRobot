# ToyRobot
This is a .net core console app made for the Telstra Purple ToyRobot assessment.
It should run on any Visual Studio debugger.
As per the request, it takes case insensitive string arguments from the console application to place, rotate and move the robot and will do so perpetually until the user types 'report'.
